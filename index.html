            <p>“Sam, Tabby, and I are going to camp out back of Tabby’s grandfather’s place tonight,” I yelled to my parents as I went down the basement stairs to my room. The door to the basement was only a few feet from the front door, so most times, I could make it down the stairs before my parents realized I was home. This time, though, I needed to get moving quickly. Might as well get the story out there first. Everything depended on the three of us making it to the site before sundown.</p>

            <p>“Hi, Cat, glad you’re home,” my mother yelled from somewhere vaguely upstairs. “It’s been a long time since you three went camping,” I was still halfway down the stairs and stopped. I couldn’t tell my parents the real reason. They are both such nice people; they might smile and nod or lock me in a nuthouse.</p>
